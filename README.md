# Function_Pointer_2020
Exercise to begin to understand function pointers

None of the exercises work, your goal is to make sure each and everyone work perfectly.

To compile each exercise, you need to type in *'make exo1'* for the first, *'make exo2'* for the second... and so on.

To launch the program you have compiled, you will need to type *'./exo1 2 3'* for the first, *'./exo2'* for the first... and so on.

**GOOD LUCK AND HAVE FUN !!!**
